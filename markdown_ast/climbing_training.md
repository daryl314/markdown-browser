## Strategy ##

* Use video to understand weaknesses and what went well/poorly on an attempt.  Set up phone on a stand. Watch elite climbers (in person and in climbing videos) and pay attention
* 20 minutes rest between bouldering burns is optimal when trying to send
* matt doesn't like it when i'm too aggressive with my encouragement (C'MON!).  maybe others don't like it either.
* Super glue on tape
* vocalizing can help in certain situations
* Consider getting a movement coach at some point.

### Climbing in the Cold ###

* put rocks on propane heater and put in chalk bag to keep warm in winter
* On cold sport climbing days, hang onto whatever holds i can reach at ground level until my fingers get really cold.  Warm up in down mittens, and then go for the send.
* Keep shoes inside jacket when I have them off

## Finger Strength ##
  
### Strategy ###

* offseason when friction is bad: consider low weight repeaters on tweaky holds to grease the groove
* fingerboarding: better to be tensed with elbows slightly bent than a true dead hang
* consider using opposite foot with pulley to remove weight instead of opposite hand
* To train pinch strength, pick up weighted blocks with a pinch grip.  This gets around the tendency to "cheat" on pinches with compression.
* When fingerboarding, use shorter duration sets.  One coach recommends 4 seconds on and 12 seconds off.
* May want to consider slowly building up monos and crimps with fewer than 4 fingers
* Can use index in small 2-finger pocket and middle in one pad mono if front 2 hurts
* may want to mix in assisted one-arms and front levers
* consider warming up with burpees (3 x 10)
* gresham trains half-crimp, open hand, and 2-finger half-crimp

#### Michael Penn on chalk ####

"I used to struggle with friction all of the time and I think I finally have a fix: Between the first few reps wipe your fingers together to redistribute the chalk. For the last few reps wipe your fingers on your shirt/shorts.  After a few reps the chalk is gone, but the beastmaker is almost stickier with no chalk and a perfect amount of moisture."

### Workout Schedule ###

Michael Penn does a set of 333, a set of 555, and sometimes a set of max hangs per week.  He also does 1-2 sessions of body strength.  Used to do a set of repeaters and a set of max repeaters when training for China Beach.

### Workouts ###

#### Fingerboarding 3x3 and 3x5 repeaters ####

These are intended to be more strength builders than the classic repeaters workout without the mental load of max weight hangs.  For each grip (back 2, front 2, middle 2, half-crimp, pinch block):

* (7s hang grip 1, 3s rest) x {3 or 5}
* 1.5 min rest
* (7s hang grip 1, 3s rest) x {3 or 5}
* 1.5 min rest
* (7s hang grip 1, 3s rest) x {3 or 5}
* 3 min rest
* MOVE TO NEXT GRIP

Record the level of difficulty (E/M/H/HH/HHH) or the rep where failure occurred for each set.  The goal of adjusting the weight is to get very hard or close fail on the last rep without injury.  Also record suggested weight for next session.

#### Fingerboard Max Hangs (Winter 2010) ####

tiger tail forearms before and after workout.  not sure what timing i used to use, but starting something every 60 seconds seems to work.  (LH exercise 1 at 1:00, RH exercise 1 at 2:00, LH exercise 2 at 3:00, RH exercise 2 at 4:00, etc.)

## Strength Training ##

### Strategies ###

Grease the groove by doing a strength exercise at 1/3 - 2/3 effort multiple times a day

### Workouts ###

#### Square Lockoffs ####

* Don't drop either knee.
* Use 1.5" 60 degree crimp eventually but start on jug.
* Put opposite foot on a hold on opposite side of center (maybe a foot or two past hold) and frog knee out.
* Paste same side foot out to side on wall to make a triangle
* Focus on engaging shoulder and pulling it back into socket
* Pull up with one arm and dig hard with toe to get as much reach as possible
* Hold at top of lock and lower back down

#### GH-lockoffs ####

#### Bodyweight rows ####

#### Abs ####

* Levers x 4, bicycle levers x 2, knees to elbows x 2

#### Pull Strength ####

* Pull strength: may want to consider doing some assisted one arm sets with bm2k holds like the 20 degree slopers
* For back strength, heavy rows are probably more sport-specific than pull-ups except for really high-end bouldering.
* OAP: have logs
* Pull up with both arms and lower with one.  Repeat until failure.
* Focus on shorter boulder problems to build up strength instead of the popular endurance problems.  Another option is to use the system wall to invent problems with 2 really hard moves.

#### kettlebell ####

* Pavel S&S
* Pavel C&P ladders

## Power Training ##

### Strategy ###

* May want to focus some effort on uneven pulls like 1-2-5 or 1-4-5 instead of 1-3-5
* Campusing is rough on shoulders.  Should probably pair with stretching and kb's to maintain balance.
* Weighted campusing can be safer than huge moves that are rough on the shoulders.  Try to work up to 50 1-3-5-5 on small rungs with 50 pounds of added weight.  Build upper body strength in other ways (like heavy rows)

### Workouts ###

* Weighted campusing on small wooden rungs working up 5 pounds at a time to 50 pounds added (55-7-99)
* Weighted campusing on large rungs with 50 pounds added (back strength focus)
* Sideways dynos on system wall generating as much momentum as possible with lower body to maximize recruitment in the catching hand.  Flag one leg to wind up and generate swing.
* One handed circuits on system wall keeping other hand on a single hold
* Doubles on PVC rungs: Up 3, Down 2, Up 3, Down 2, Down 2; Up 2, Down 2 to failure

#### Sean McColl - Campus Board Training ####

BKB Notes

* Start on high rung to make it more comfortable - it's a high board so no need to deal with swing on first pull
* Go for max distance: 4-7
* Aim with pinky finger when doing half crimp campusing
* Don't bother with big rungs. Rounded and awkward
* Get amped and vocalize 

Medium rung workout (starting on 2 minute intervals)

* Ladder up by 1's
* Ladder up by 2's leading with LH
* Ladder up by 2's leading with RH
* 4-7-9 leading with LH
* 4-7-9 leading with RH
* Big dynamic moves (shoot for 4-8) leading with LH first (drop a rung and twist body on lower)
* Big dynamic moves (shoot for 4-8) leading with RH firstBumping LH (4-7-8-7-8...)
* Bumping RH (4-7-8-7-8...)
* Bumping LH (4-6-7-6-7...)
* Bumping RH (4-6-7-6-7...)
* Double up by 1's
* Double up by 2's
* Double up by 2's
* Offset doubles (1 rung offset) leading with LH
* Offset doubles (1 rung offset) leading with RH
* Alternating hands (1 rung offset) on big PVC rungs

Small rung workout (starting on 3 minute intervals)

* M ladder once
* S ladder once
* S 4-6-7-7 w/ each
* S 4-6-8-8 w/ each
* S 4-7-9-9 (or 8-8 if fail) w/ each
* M 4-5 offset doubles w/ each
 
## Power Endurance Training ##

Michael Penn does 1-2 sessions of foot on campusing per week.

### Workouts ###

#### Campus board AnCap ####

* **Power end of spectrum:** Sloper rail or 100 degree 1" rung AnCap up only (0:30 on, 1:00 off) using every other rung
* **Power (moonclimbing.com):** Ladder 1-3-5-3-1 or 1-4-7-4-1 and repeat with other hand.  Don't match on top rung.
* **Endurance end of spectrum:** Sloper rail or wooden rung AnCap staying on for entire time (0:30 on, 2:00 off)
* Do 8 sets of intervals.  Start on interval instead of worrying about working for entire interval (build up to working for full interval)
* Strategy 
    * Focus on bearing down with fingers on 100 degree rung (be active!) 
    * Mark first rung with tape for easy spotting
    * Brush first rung
    * Shake arms in rest interval and/or do shoulder circles
    * Come up with a "tripwire" for warming up -- switch to an endurance-based warmup when bouldering isn't going so well
    * Vocalize for more power
    * Sloper rails have more friction near center

Adam Ondra changes the exercise he uses for campus power endurance every session. 
Try static locks and uneven pull ups.  Ondra flips lower hand for uneven pull ups or
to do a 1-5-9

#### Campus board power endurance ####

* Ladder on campus board with feet on a rung
* 1-2-3-3-2-1-1 repeated for work interval. Easiest to use center of rungs when crimping
* About a move every second
* If you fall in a set, rest for 5 seconds, get back on, and finish set
* Rest by shaking off a big jug with feet on chair in front.  Alternate exercises include:
    * jumping rope
    * ring exercises
    * kettle bell swings
    * burpees
    * rowing at a pace around 15 seconds slower than 500m max

#### Finger board power endurance ####

* Do 45 sec to 3 min blocks of 7 seconds on and 3 seconds off with an equal amount of rest.  Do 4-10 rounds.
* Want first 1/3 fairly comfortable, second 1/3 struggle, last 1/3 failure
* Use half crimp or open grip.  Can stick with same grip or mix it up (alternate grips or do in blocks)
* Can involve arms by doing fingertip pullups in blocks with a strict rest cycle.  (Do x pullups starting on every minute for 3-8 minutes, rest 3-6 minutes, repeat 3-8 times)

### Gym-specific notes ###

* BKB: start on 3rd rung with feet on bottom foot rung.
* CRG Watertown: start on rung 6 and feet on lower rail; lower down first
* CRG Cambridge: start on rung 4 and feet on lower rail. Lower to rung 2. Start on downward sloping blue rail and switch to wooden rungs after failure

### Long-term objective ###

3 minutes on and 3 minutes off to match Flour Power interval lengths -- http://vimeo.com/96724723.  10 x 45/15 maxi pulls.

* 30 seconds to knee bar in slot above first bolt
* 3 minutes to sit down rest
* 2.5 minutes to shake
* 45 seconds to flour power chains
* 45 seconds to shake
* 1.5 minutes to pushin' up daisies chains

## Aerobic Training ##

### Notes ###

* Can use tread wall or circuits on system wall in place of bouldering
* Can also use intervals of 30 seconds on and 30 seconds off
* Laps on toprope with no rest between burns seem to be a really good workout. 
* traverses at LW as a training option
* Daniel Woods does 5 sets of up-down-up on bouldering problems in a cave (around V11-V7-V11) with 5-10 minutes rest between sets

### Workouts ###

#### Maxi Pulls ####

* Workout is 10 hangs on sloper rails starting on 1 minute intervals (resting for remainder of interval)
* Cambridge (bad sloper rails): use rail 4 with feet matched on low rung.  Straighten and reset left middle finger once established to avoid knuckle pain
* Watertown (better sloper rails): rail 4 without feet.  Use hollow position
* Strategy
    * Use thumbs for better friction and put hands slightly inside 2-screw pair
    * Step back on with broken sets

##### Standard workout #####

* Standard workout seems to be 3 sets of (6 x (45 seconds on and 15 seconds off), rest 5 minutes)
* Doing 10 reps is madness cave level endurance
* 4" pipe with skateboard grip tape is recommended for deep pump workouts.  7" pipe is more applicable to pure strength.

Additional Uses:

1. Use like a normal fingerboard to train intervals or max hangs (harder from lower position).  It helps to bear down hard from the start to prevent or delay the slide and loss of position on the hold.
2. Hang for max time each interval and rest 15 or 30 seconds.  Repeat and watch the hang time drop off
3. Get pumped silly with normal protocol and attempt to recover.  Do increasing length rest/hang intervals repeating each stage enough times to move to the next level.  Tune ratio of rest to hang to barely allow recovery and simulate shaking on a giant open hand edge
    * rest 2 / hang 4
    * rest 4 / hang 8
    * rest 6 / hang 12
    * rest 8 / hang 16
    * rest 10 / hang 20 
4. Increase awareness of pump monitoring accuracy and ability to recover from the brink of failure

#### Tread wall mileage ####

Jon suggests doing mileage on the tread wall with all holds at progressively steeper angles for each set. It measures feet so you can build up and measure progress

#### Boulder the gym ####

Do every boulder problem in the gym below a threshold (V3 or V4) from left to right

#### Suicides ####

#### Power suicides ####

#### Circle bouldering ####

Create a circular route on one of the steep bouldering walls and do laps until failure

## Recovery and Injury Prevention ##

### Ongoing Shoulder Exercises ###

It is important to keep doing these so that I don't end up having problems in the future.  Maybe a few times a week (one climbing trainer says I/Y/T 2x/week and bands 3-4x/week).  Mix and match from the following

* Band exercises (internal, external, overhead internal, overhead external, rows)
* Reverse I (down to side with thumb down) and T (palm down -- or thumb down?) on bed 2x10x3s
* I's (thumb up), T's (palm down), and Y's (thumb up) on ball. Pinch shoulder blades together. https://vimeo.com/82982291/description
* I's, Y's, and T's with TRX.  Squeeze shoulder blades together and lead with back of hands in direction of motion.  Start on 2 minute intervals (or 1 minute intervals):
    * Push-ups (both arms and then single-arm)
    * External rotation (might be bad for rotator cuff)
    * Split I
    * Y
    * T
    * W
    * Rows
* Ball pushups (keeping scapula tension)
* Body blade
    * Forward and backward with elbow next to side (50 count)
    * Side to side with elbow next to side (50 count)
    * Elbow up at 45 degrees and arm forward (50 count)
    * Elbow straight out and arm forward (50 count)
    * Crossing body (2 reps)
* Bodyweight rows on rings (keeping scapula tension instead of sagging)

### Ongoing Shoulder Mobilization ###

Use timer at work to remind me to take stretch breaks.  Do exercises to warm up for climbing

* Shoulder stretches in doorway (do twice a day forever)
* Stretches lying on foam roller (to side and overhead)
* Mobilize pecs (lacrosse ball against wall), lats (foam roller), scapula (lacrosse ball; note from Mike Choi)
* Shoulder dislocates focusing on moving grip inward
* Wall slides
* Eagle arms
* Cow face arms
* Upward plank?  (See note in inbox)
* Mobilization exercises (Process note in inbox)

### Todo List ###

* Scapula mobility and strengthening: [https://peteshawstrength.com/2014/03/20/scapular-strength-and-stability/]
* There are letters beyond IYT (WPL?).  Figure out what to do with them.
* Make sure to hang with shoulders engaged and with external rotation (should have shoulders lower instead of up by ears) [http://blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/experience-story?cid=esther-smith-shoulder-maintenance-for-climbers]

### Resources ###

- Acute finger tendon/pulley injury management with Dan Mirsky and Esther Smith: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWZQMnlHEbg

### Misc ###

------------------

* J-Star uses arm aid and rice bucket
* Do thera band shoulder exercises as part of warmup
* x-tensor: 5-10 seconds/rep, 10-20 reps/set, rotate wrist while using
* Active recovery is more effective than passive recovery ([http://lifeinthevertical.co.uk/blogs/climbingcoach/2009/09/28/climbing-recovery/]).  Walk around or jog lightly between burns.  Jogging in place is an option for multi-pitch climbs.

Warming up: do some bouldering or bring a portable fingerboard to the crag to get warm again before doing a burn.  This is especially true if you've had a long break to rest or belay.  Need to pull on something small before roping up again.  Shoulder exercises with theraband are also useful in the warmup.

### climbing contrast baths (From John) ###

He was taught this by his physical therapy group.

## Skin Care ##
  
**Recovering from persistent cracks**

* After a skin injury, tape over the skin while climbing at the gym to let it heal
* After the skin grows back a bit, trim the dead skin around the crack with scissors or curved nail clippers.  It can be helpful to press nail clippers into the crack to get at the inset edge.  This works best after showering.
* Sand down with a pumice stone after showering until crack is no longer visible
* Apply healing salve or climb on bar.  Pack split with climb on overnight.

**General notes**

* Use healing salve after climbing.  Especially if I fingerboarded and used liquid chalk
* Use climb on bar at work
* Don't reapply chalk when bouldering at the gym in the winter unless really necessary.  Chalk once when starting.
* Super glue tape to fingers for better performance

### From Joshua Tree Climbing Salve web site ###

**After Climbing**

* Wash with soap & water - clean skin heals faster!
* Clip or remove any dead torn skin.
* Groom calluses - Use a pumice stone to thin out thick spots.
* Rinse hands with alcohol (rubbing alcohol, not bourbon) to clean the micro-cuts, and dry and harden the skin.
* Liberally apply JTree Salve... reapply throughout the evening.
* If it's oily for more than 10 minutes, use a bit less next time. It should soak right in to dry damaged skin!

**Do This... Don't Do That!**

* Use JTree in the morning and at night on rest days to help condition skin.
* Use JTree for any skin irritation, and for dry skin.
* Always keep JTree with you & share with friends!
* Don't use salve right before you train or compete.
* Avoid lotions - They soften skin making it rip and tear.

### Skin Care for Boulderers (from Rock & Ice) ###

* Anhydrol (www.foosball.com) is a strong hand drying agent.  Add a very small amount to hands before bed the night before climbing or over a series of 2 or 3 nights before.  Wash residue off palms the next morning.  Effects will last for days after 2 or 3 treatments: chalk will stay on better and small holds will hurt less.  Be careful, as too much can make skin glassy and cause deeply split fingers.  Only apply to palms and tips of fingers, and avoid letting it touch creases of finger joints
* Joshua tree healing salve (www.jtlife.com) right after climbing (keep in pack)

### Another reference ###

Every seasoned boulderer will remember times when a session or trip was cut short, simply due to the skin on their fingertips becoming so thin that climbing became impossible. You simply can’t climb if the skin on your fingertips in worn away to a certain level – even pulling on a good hold can be painful, and using a tiny crimp becomes impossible. Normally your skin will recover from this state sufficiently to climb again in two to three days, but it can take longer if you’ve really worn it down. There are a number of crucial tricks to prevent your skin from getting into this state of disrepair. First, you’ll need two crucial tools: some fine sandpaper, plus a good supply of a skin-regenerating product (for example Climb On, or a Vitamin-E rich skin product like Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour cream).

The first thing to use is the sandpaper. Whilst bouldering (the same goes for working a route with a bouldery, crimpy section) your fingertips will develop tiny abraded ‘ridges’ of skin where the rock has cut into the top layer. These ridges become worse after each hard pull on a small hold, eventually tearing away the whole top layer of skin. However, if you use fine sandpaper to remove them as soon as they appear, you’ll find your skin is stronger and lasts for much longer during your bouldering session. As soon as you finish, you should use the sandpaper again to remove any ridges or abrasions on the surface of skin, then immediately apply your chosen skin-nourishing product.

The final – and perhaps most important – point to make here is to always finish your session before pulling on small holds becomes painful. If you’re on a bouldering trip, conserving skin is of the utmost importance, since a split fingertip could mean up to a week off.  Another useful trick here is to structure your climbing around short sessions of no more than three to four hours (this is a particularly good tactic in warmer conditions where early morning and evening bouldering is the norm). If you only climb for a short period, your skin won’t get so thin and will also have longer to recover. The powerful and intensive nature of bouldering as an activity also lends itself much better to short sessions than to whole days of effort. As a final thought on this matter, it is worth remembering that few elite boulderers will ever have sessions of more than four hours. This allows a couple of hours to fully warm up, then a couple of hours at peak performance. Beyond the four hour mark, even the fittest boulderers will begin to fatigue and their skin will begin to thin.

## Climbing Technique ##

### Trad Notes ###

* When girth hitching a tree, put hitch at side of tree instead of center - better pull direction
* If a single sling is too big to girth hitch a tree, can wrap a single around the tree and girth hitch the two ends together with a second sling to keep it snug
* Racking
    * back left - utility stuff
    * back right - big cams, yosemite racked singles
    * front loops - yosemite racked draws, cams 0.5 to 2 on biners, <0.5 on one biner, nuts

#### Splitter Camp ####

* jamming thumb down: can reach higher, can torque sideways in wide hand cracks
* jamming thumb up: can bring down lower on body to extend reach
* make big moves when crack climbing to cover more distance.  use my power to my advantage
* foot jams: really drop the heel so that the outside pinky edge of shoe is in the crack.  almost like a layback when in a dihedral, as the bottom of the foot is against the wall, and the outside edge of the shoe is pushing against the crack
* taping: 6" strips across the back of the hand.  start with the middle finger, and place a strip from the underside of the first knuckle to the wrist.  flatten and smooth out the tape.  work your way outward from the middle finger with more strips of tape.  loosely wrap around the wrist a few times.  loosely wrap a half-strip around the first joint of each finger.  don't use a palm wrap.  it will just ball up and get annoying.

#### Other Crack Climbing ####

* when taping, start the index finger tape on the side of the finger for more coverage.  avoid angling inward more than i have to to cover as much as possible of the back of my hand.  i tend to get gobies here.  use the thumb tape to hold the index finger tape in place and prevent it from rolling up.  (add tape to back of thumb too)
* when climbing big hands, can get something of a layback with the hand meathooked in the crack.  lean away from the back of the hand so that the back of the hand cams into the opposite side of the crack.

### Ice Notes ###

* flick wrist at end of swing
* kick in with front of boots where the points are instead of having foot sideways
* clear ice out of screws when removing.  hold tip to protect and bang base on boots or on ice
* when putting axes down, put the blade side down so that the handles don't get all snowy

### Sport/bouldering Notes ###

#### 2013 Clinic ####

* warm up focusing on placing hands and not adjusting them
* when climbing on slopers, focus on moving them to the side or moving around them instead of bearing down on them. keep upper and lower body separate - move feet without moving hips and then do the next move
* really focus on placing feet precisely. watch placements, and think about best parts of hold to use beforehand. think about what direction to pull with feet.
* think about where to position knee to really rock over on heel hooks
* be positive. never say you can't do something out loud.  okay to admit that something is hard, but not to say that it's impossible.

#### BRG Technique Lesson ####

* Focus on climbing with straight arms more.  Twist through with the shoulders and back while keeping the arms straight.
* On big holds, only use the fingers that you need to rest the others
* Work on incorporating the open hand grip more
* Take advantage of opportunities to use the thumb
* Curl the thumb over the top of fingers on crimps for added strength
* Keep elbows into the body when pulling to conserve strength.  (Inner grip verticle rows versus outer grip horizontal rows.)
* Try to locate a section that will be difficult while still on the ground: visualization
* Focus on finding good rests
* Don't let footwork get sloppy on easier climbs.  Use the toe, not the middle of the shoe.
* Slabs force good footwork
* Watch shorter people climb
* Bouldering for footwork
* Stemming drill - shift both hands to one side of wall and move foot a little bit.  Have to really focus on the angle of the foot to not slip.
* Layback drill on big crack
* Point toe when heel hooking to get more surface area covered
* Clip off good holds (go a little higher and clip sometimes)

## Lattice Training ##
  
### Overview ###

The objective is to train both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems.  The two energy systems are divided into capacity (size of the tank) and power (size of the output pipe).

* **Aerobic Capacity**: ability to climb without getting pumped and to recover in rests.  Improving this increases the threshold for getting pumped
* **Anaerobic Capacity**: ability to climb on hard sustained sequences.  Requires aerobic capacity and aerobic power to handle the lactate produced
* **Aerobic Power**: ability to climb while pumped out of your mind (endurance end of power endurance training)
* **Anaerobic Power**: ability to continue to execute hard moves (power end of power endurance training)
* **Strength**: critically important but not discussed here

Energy systems adapt fully on different time scales and drive structure of training.  Spending more than 8 weeks working on power is inefficient use of time that could have been better spent elsewhere.

| Energy System   | Adaptation Time |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Aerobic Cap     | 8+ weeks        |
| Anaerobic Cap   | 16+ weeks       |
| Aerobic Power   | 6-8 weeks       |
| Anaerobic Power | 6-8 weeks       |

### Assessment ###

Assessment of energy system performance is done in the Lattice Performance Analysis.  Finger strength is quantified first, and then energy systems are tested at 60% of the max 2-hand load (sum of the weights that each hand can handle individually).  Lactate curve is sets of 7:3 hangs to failure with rest time equal to work time.  Anaerobic power is 10:3 time to failure? More details are in the LPA protocols document.

* **Aerobic Capacity**: anaerobic capacity times aerobic contribution.  Goal is to raise this number to 7 or more by slowing down the rate of decline in the lactate curve
* **Anaerobic Capacity**: ratio of the final lactate curve measurement to the first lactate curve measurement.  Goal is 20-30%
* **Aerobic Power**: first lactate curve measurement (7:3 time).  Goal is 200+ seconds
* **Anaerobic Power**: not mentioned in report, but assuming to be the max hang time since it's the only number that wasn't used anywhere else
* **Aerobic Contribution**: (7:3 - 10:3)/7:3.  Measurement of balance in aerobic and anaerobic energy systems, and around 30% is considered to be an excellent number
* **Strength**: finger strength is measured by the half-crimp load that each hand can handle relative to bodyweight.  Goal is to be able to hang from each hand with bodyweight.  Back and chest strength are measured by number of pull-ups and push-ups performed without stopping to rest, respectively.

#### Alternative assessment ####

A foot on campussing protocol can be used to mirror a lattice assessment:

1. Complete a maximal effort (time) of foot on laddering (1-2-3-2-1 feet on foot holds). You should aim to be working for between 2-6 minutes to make the exercise aerobic but not fail due to complete energy store depletion after 6 sets. 
2. Rest for the time you spent laddering the campus rungs. If you lasted 3 minutes rest for 3 minutes. 
3. Repeat this process of maximal efforts vs 1:1 work rest ratios for 6 bouts of campus laddering. 
4. Record your scores. (E.G. 5-4-3.5-3-2-2MINS)

Complete a difficult route or circuit of climbing until you are very pumped. You should finish the climb with a pump level of 9-10/10. Now move directly onto an easy route which is way below your on-sight limit. Record the amount of time it takes you to reduce muscle pump and feel ready for a harder effort again. Your pump level should feel around 4-5/10 now. Recording the time of recovery on route allows a measuring point and using your own interpretation can provide an individual awareness of having better recovery. This is great method to use because despite being less scientific and controllable it really helps climbers learn more about their personal route strategies.

Using both these methods can allow a baseline to be set. After another training intervention working your aerobic capacity you can repeat these testing protocols and look for differences. Yes, other training adaptations will effect the result, but it will help provide insight into your recovery.

#### Finger Strength Standards ####

**Q**: What is the max combined (bodyweight+weight) max hang recorded? And was it a proper half crimp?

**A**: Which ever way you look at it, it's extremely rare to see absolute force over 80 kg (176.4 lb) in the forearm. The all time record is a mighty 84.5 kg (186.3 lb).  Alex is a fair way off this (75 kg or 165.3 lb) but holds the percentage bodyweight record by virtue of the fact that he's 20kg lighter than the total weight record holder. The above scores are all on the standard lattice edge we have at all assessment walls. Where a lattice edge isn't available we recommend a beastmaker 1k bottom outside edge, or an 18mm campus rung.

#### Finding Your Weaknesses ####
(From Epic TV Video)

Improve weaknesses on a systems board.  Film yourself or use a partner.  3 examples:
- Do twisting cross-overs.  Twist from feet to incorporate whole body.  Start off small and gradually increase difficulty.  Will indicate differences between right and left side and where movement might be lacking.
- Stay square to wall, use gastons, and pull with feet.  Look at muscles around shoulders and hips to check for stability throughout the move (or whether you need to get stronger in a particular portion)
- Find a movement that exploits a weakness and work left and right sides.

Make movement repetitious and hard enough so that you can only complete 5-10 repetitions in quick order with 3 sets.  Aim to make movement as specific as possible to your weakness.  Maintain a strict body position throughout the exercise.

### Training Cycles ###

Training cycle is designed to be in peak shape for a 2-3 week sport climbing trip (or a window when a local project is likely to be in condition).  An ideal training cycle would involve 4 months of building strength and base capacity (with more of a focus on the slower adapting anaerobic capacity for the first half) followed by 2 months working on power to prepare for a peak.  Base phase includes a high volume of work and basic conditioning.  Peak phase includes a lower volume of training with high intensity with the emphasis on quality over quantity.

* **Base 1**: Prioritize strength and anaerobic capacity with some aerobic capacity mixed in.  Anaerobic and aerobic power are maintained only.
* **Base 2**: Prioritize strength, anaerobic, and aerobic capacity.  Anaerobic and aerobic power are maintained only.
* **Peak**: Prioritize anaerobic and aerobic power to prepare for trip.  Shift strength work towards explosive power. 
* **Taper**: Reduce output in last week or two of peak phase to be ready for trip.  Drop volume to about 50% of normal training load, stop doing capacity or ARC training, and focus only on hard strength/power work.  Create circuits that replicate the structure of goals (bouldery sections, resistance sections, easier sections, and shake-outs)

#### General Notes ####

* Hard energy system work (anaerobic capacity, anaerobic power, aerobic power) can be done up to 3 days per week
* When focusing on anaerobic capacity, 2 sessions per week is sufficient
* Can keep anaerobic capacity going at 1 session per week until 4 weeks before the trip (but this makes aerobic power work critical)
* When focusing on aerobic power, 2 sessions per week are sufficient if doing large sessions
* Start training weeks on Saturday so that weekly plan can be created after weekend climbing outside
* Keep a training diary

#### Combining Components ####

* Always start with most intense and work down to least intense:
  bouldering --> anaerobic capacity/power --> aerobic power --> aerobic capacity --> ARC
* Anaerobic capacity workouts work well after strength sessions.  Can also do anaerobic capacity as an evening workout after a day bouldering outside if still reasonably fresh
* Anaerobic power can be tacked on after a shortened bouldering session, or before aerobic power/capacity work
* Big muscle strength work that require less coordination (basic exercises) can be done later in the workout
* Aerobic capacity training and ARC can be done at the end of other sessions, especially if aerobic capacity isn't being prioritized

#### Adapting to Non-Ideal Schedules ####

Need to count backwards from peak time and look at how strengths and weaknesses stack up against requirements at peak time.  Keep a taper phase and adjust lengths of phases accordingly.

#### Example Schedule (5 Days per Week, 1.5-2 Hours per Session) ####

**Base**:

* 4x strength including 2x anaerobic capacity.  Bouldering, fingerboard, campusing, etc
* 0.5x aerobic/anaerobic power (half session of maintenance followed by aerobic capacity)
* Aerobic capacity and ARC on the end of some other sessions

**Peak 1 (4 weeks)**:

* 3x strength including 1x anaerobic capacity
* 1.5x aerobic power
* 0.5x anaerobic power
* Low volume aerobic capacity and ARC at the end of sessions
* Consider replacing the post-strength anaerobic capacity workout with some anaerobic power work to have 2 full aerobic power sessions

**Peak 2 (4 weeks)**:

* 3x strength including plenty of explosive bouldering or campusing
* 2x aerobic power
* 1x anaerobic power
* Small amount of ARC as a warm down only

### Training Energy Systems ###

These are some example exercises, but this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list.  There are many more options out there.  To make circuits, set up 2 or 3 problems and find a way to link them together; pick 3 problems with a good wall angle, drop off, and immediately pull back on; or steal problems from other people and use feet to adjust difficulty.  Climbing up is more realistic than traversing or climbing in circles. 

Energy system      | Work Period          | Rest Period                 | Objective
-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------
Aerobic capacity   | 10+ minutes          | n/a                         | Sustained light pump
Anaerobic capacity | 12-15 moves (30-40s) | Long (2-4x work period)     | Powered out feeling
Aerobic power      | ~30 moves (45-120s)  | Short (~1x work period)     | Pumped out of your mind
Anaerobic power    | 5-7 moves            | Very short (<= work period) | Powered out feeling

* Aerobic capacity: 8-12 reps that can be broken into sets of 3-5 reps with ~10 min between sets
* Aerobic power: One block of ~8 reps or multiple blocks of ~4 reps for higher volume
* Anaerobic power: 4 reps per set with 10 minute rests between sets

#### ARC and Aerobic Capacity ####

Exercises are not intended to reach terminal pump, and should not lead to failure.  Increase intensity or volume if the exercises get too easy.  ARC is the easier end of the aerobic capacity spectrum.  This can be boring, so have some good music or podcasts.

**Continuous climbing at constant intensity**: stay on the wall for 20-40 minutes using routes (ideal), traversing, or a bouldering wall.  10 minutes at the end of a workout can help flush out muscles after getting pumped.  This is particularly good for ARC.

**General Climbing: x-on, x-off**: break work into shorter chunks when operating at the harder end of the aerobic capacity spectrum, and try to avoid excess rest periods.  10-on-10-off is a common structure.  Can be done effectively with routes.  Off periods can be replaced by ARC to get a continuous 30-40 minutes of climbing.  May need to do less than 40 minutes of hard aerobic capacity work or reduce intensity when doing this at the end of other sessions.  30 seconds on and 30 seconds off can be good training for redpointing

**Speed Top Roping**: Lead an easy route with large holds and large moves (perhaps 2 number grades below French grade onsight level), and top rope it repeatedly for 10 minutes.  Lower off as quickly as possible, do not shake or chalk, and use momentum to climb as quickly as possible.  Pick a harder route if you aren't panting and pushing hard at the end of a 10 minute block.  Good on occasion to mix things up, but doing too often could mess up normal climbing style.

**Route 4x4s**: Lead a route, lower off, and lead it again 3 more times without untying between reps.  Belay partner while they do the same, and ideally move to a different route for the next set.

**Foot-on Campusing**: move up down and around on campus rungs (typically jugs) with feet on rungs, and shake an arm on pretty much every move.  Mix in some time on smaller rungs to make it harder if it's too easy (try to get to 10 minutes alternating between 1 minute on jugs and 1 minute on smaller rungs).  Barrows does 1-2-3-4-5-5-4-3-2-1 on jugs and 3-4-4-3-3-4-4-3-3 on smaller rungs and finds the exercise to be very effective.

##### 20 Minute Endurance Boost Video #####

20 minute endurance boost workouts.  Important to dial in intensity level.  Very effective use of time.  2 x per week for 8 weeks.  Settle for about a 50/50 split between the two workouts

Longer interval workout:
- done ONLY at the end of a climbing session
- very low level of pump
- 2 number grades below onsight level
- should feel relaxed enough to talk
- 2 blocks of 8 minutes with 2 minutes rest between each

Shorter interval workout:
- done ONLY at the end of a climbing session
- moderate to high level of pump
- 1-2 letter grades below onsight level
- 10 x (1 min climb, 1 min rest)
- should feel taxing but not at limit
- back off a letter grade or two if you feel close to failure by the end of the session

#### Anaerobic Capacity ####

Objective is to get powered down instead of pumped, and the standard exercise is climbing long boulders with limited rest: 12-15 moves (30-50s) with a rest time of 2-4 times the climb time.  Rest is calibrated to the first lap and remains fixed for the set.  Modulate intensity using the number of moves and the rest multiplier to target failure on around 25% of reps.  Increase difficulty or length of circuit instead of reducing rest times.  Difficulty could be around flash limit or a little harder.

* **Strength focus**: 12 moves with 4x rest time
* **Power focus**: 15 moves with 2x rest time
* **Single block**: 8-10 reps
* **Multiple blocks**: blocks of 3-5 reps with 10-20 min rest between sets (re-warming up after resting), e.g. 3 sets of 4 reps
* **Campus board** (easiest to adjust intensity): ladder for 15-20 moves (faster than bouldering moves)
* **Finger board** (less effective): 4 hangs of 7 seconds with 3 seconds rest between hangs

#### Aerobic Power ####

Objective is to get horribly pumped with climbing that is sustained and homogeneous instead of cruxy to avoid early failure, so get right back on if you fall due to technical error.  This energy system responds best to reducing rest times, so it can be helpful to have some exercises that remain consistent (like foot on campusing) throughout the peak phase where rests can be steadily reduced.  When using climbing circuits, it's more important to vary the circuits for stimulus than to be methodical about rest time reduction.  Literature says that rest time should be less than or equal to climbing type, but longer rests can be used on circuits to allow for use of harder sequences.

**Circuits**: around 30 moves without shake outs with rest time between 1-2 times the climbing time.  Can throw in pretend clipping positions to slow down to a more realistic speed for outdoor climbing.  Traditional circuits are 8 reps with failure on rep 7 or 8 and are very time efficient.  For high volume, use something like 6 sets of 4 reps with 10-20 minute rest between sets.  

**On-the-minute**: climb a 6-8 move boulder problem for about 20 seconds climbing and 40 seconds rest and do 8 reps per set.  Adjust number of sets based on desired volume and intensity of the problem used.

**Boulder 4x4s**: do 4 reps of 4 boulder problems in a row with no rest with 1-3 minutes of rest between reps. Can vary by doing multiple blocks or increasing the number of reps.

**Foot-on campusing** (brutal): do a sequence of moves that takes around a minute to complete, rest 1-2 times the work time, and aim to reduce rest time slightly for each session.  Blocks of 8 reps (failing on the last couple) are great after doing other aerobic power work.  Can do patterns of moves that involve moving the feet, or count in head to slow down movement to a more realistic outdoor pace.

##### Power Endurance Video #####

1. Improve the aerobic function of the muscles
2. Focus on working the 'pump' at the end of your training cycle.

Start climbing on a climb at or slightly above redpoint level
Work climb into 4 sections on the wall and figure out how long it takes to climb each
Rest 50% of the work duration
One set is climbing all 4 sections with their relevant rest
Look to do 2-4 sets in total
Shouldn't lead to failure

4 weeks before wanting to be in peak shape:
Reduce rest by 5 seconds between each section of climb every week
Will go from 30 seconds of rest to 10 seconds of rest over 4 weeks

- Very high intensity but keeping the pump manageable until the end of the session
- You must climb on a climb that REPLICATES your chosen goal in duration, intensity, and speed
- To do this at a high enough intensity then you will need to break into blocks with short rests

Not suitable to do this year round.  8 weeks is about right with maybe 2 sessions per week.  Consider taking a rest week in the middle of this training cycle.

#### Anaerobic Power ####

**Boulders with Short Rests**: 4 sets of 4 reps of 5-7 moves with rest time less than or equal to climb time, and with 10 minutes rest between sets.  4 sets is good if done after a short bouldering session or before aerobic power work; do more if only training this in a session.  Aim to work at max intensity and get powered out instead of pumped.  Reduce rest between reps to increase intensity until the 4 boulders can be done with no rest.

**Broken Circuits**: set a broken circuit of around 25 moves and break it into 3 or 4 sections to act as the boulders in the exercise above with the end goal to redoing the circuit.

**Redpoint Circuits**: pick a sustained circuit at your limit in the 20-30 move range and try to redpoint it.  Pull back on and keep trying if you fall.  Ramp up difficulty by gradually adding moves or by making the moves harder.

#### Strength ####

Barrows likes assisted one-arm dead hangs with a pulley and weights.  He uses the Beastmaker 2000 or wooden rungs and trains a variety of grips.  Does 5-10 second max hangs, 7/3 repeaters, and 5/10 repeaters.  Grips that are relevant to the project are used, and fingerboarding is done after an hour of bouldering.

##### TRX and Rings Video #####

For shoulder strength and stability
- Low TRX row for 8-10 reps (elbows down and next to body) starting with body nearly horizontal.  Take a step back and do 5 T's with thumbs pointing upward.  Rest and do 2 more sets
- 8 narrow arm ring pull-ups with arms close to body being sure to re-engage shoulders at bottom of each rep and then immediately go into 5 wide pull-ups.  Rest and do 2 more sets.
- Start with TRX by side.  Extend arms forward so they are away from body with palms down.  Spread arms to Y and then pull elbows back to W.  Pause for 1 second and reverse the movement.  Do 3 sets of 5 reps.

##### Fingerboard Routines Video #####

Need to train a grip position that is specific to goal.  Need to be well warmed up.  2-3 types per week once adapted to workout.

Muscle recruitment workout:
- Find a hang that you can do for 5-10 seconds (preferable to do a single arm hang)
- Do 8 reps of 6 second hangs for each hand.  Hang on one arm, swap arms and immediately hang on the other arm, and rest for 2 minutes
- Performance should start to drop off in set 6, 7, or 8
- Maintain a stable shoulder and grip position

Hypertrophy workout:
- Use holds that you can hang with bodyweight for a maximum of 30 seconds (will feel a lot easier to start with)
- 5 seconds on and 5 seconds off until 60 seconds are completed
- Rest 3 minutes
- Do 4-6 sets.  Okay to be failing in last few reps.
- Vary grip position from session to session

### Base Fitness (2 weeks) ###

ARCing protocol:

* Perform 2 or 3 sets of 20-45 minutes of sustained climbing right at the maximum steady-state level
* Modulate intensity to get a sustainable pump, heavy breathing, and sweating
* Mix in movement practice
* _Slightly_ increase intensity of sessions over phase

Alternatives:

* Up and down climb routes on toprope
* Go for mileage on outdoor climbing days

### Strength (4-5 weeks) ###

Fingerboarding notes:

* Record body weight, temperature, humidity, comments
* Position a fan to blow air across the hangboard
* Consider separating pocket pairs insted of doing all the grips in a row

Fingerboarding protocol (every 3 days in strength phase):

* Warm up with low-intensity ARC traversing
* Warm up with 2 sets of hangs on a bigger hold (baseline and baseline+20)
* For each grip (sets of 7 seconds on and 3 seconds off):
    * 7 reps of 7/3 at baseline weight
    * Rest 3 minutes
    * 6 reps of 7/3 at baseline + 10
    * Rest 3 minutes
    * 5 reps of 7/3 at baseline + 20
    * Rest 3 minutes
    * Move to next grip
* Suggested sequence of grips:
    * Open handed edge
    * Middle 2 one pad pocket
    * Half crimp small edge
    * Middle mono one pad pocket
    * Wide pinch
    * Front 2 deep pocket
    * Narrow pinch
* Perform supplemental exercises for core, shoulders, and pull muscles (at least 1 exercise for each)
* Rest 2 days before doing any other kind of climbing exercise

Supplemental exercises (look at other sources for more ideas):

* **Pull muscles**: Pull-ups, one-arm inverted rows, GH-lockoffs
* **Push muscles**: Push-ups, shoulder presses, dips
* **Core**: Hanging leg raises, leg lifts
* **Shoulders**: Lateral to front raise, dips, shoulder presses
* **Upper arm**: Curls, shoulder presses, dips

Lateral to front raise:
    * Use low weight and keep arms nearly straight entire time
    * Start with arms at side
    * Raise arms straight out to side stopping parallel to ground with palms facing down
    * Hold for one deep breath
    * Slowly swing arms inward until dumbells touch
    * Hold for one deep breath
    * Slowly lower dumbells back to side

Supplemental exercise schedule:

* Do on hangboard days during strength phase
* Do twice per week in power phase
* Do once per week in power endurance phase

### Power (3-4 weeks) ###

* Once campus performance plateaus, replace with limit bouldering or replace with PE
* Can use a fingerboard in a pinch

#### Warmup routine ####

* 10 minutes of ARC traversing (rehearse technique, light active stretching)
* 30 minutes of warm-up boulder ladder from V-easy to flash level with 1-3 problems at each grade
* 20 minutes of hard bouldering with 2-3 realistic problems, 3-4 quality attempts per problem, and 2-5 minutes of rest between attempts

#### Limit bouldering ####

* Choose 4 problems that have small footholds, handholds that mimic goal routes, and 1 or 2 hard dynamic moves close to ground
* Rest 2-5 minutes between attempts and 5-10 minutes between problems
* Go for 60 minutes or until power starts to fade
* Do 2-4 supplemental strength exercises (1-3 sets of 8 or fewer reps)

#### Campusing ####

Exercises:

* **Matching ladders**: ladder up and match on every rung
* **Basic ladders**: ladder up hand over hand one rung at a time
* **Max ladders**: skip as many rungs as possible in a 2-move ladder and match on top rung
* **Typewriters**: alternate bumping hands outward as far as possible and bringing them back in (hard on shoulders)
* **Max first move**: make a first move that is as big as possible and try to match the rung
* **Go-agains**: do a max first move and keep bumping the high hand up one rung at a time to failure (hard on shoulders)
* **Touches**: do a max first move, except touch rung instead of latching it.  Lower back to starting rung
* **Double dynes**: move both hands at the same time
* **Up-down-up**: down campus and then explode back up with both hands at the same time
* **1/2/3 finger campusing**: use fewer fingers to isolate finger strength

Advanced workout:

Start on 2-minute intervals.  Baseline is most difficult ladder that can be reliably executed.  Modifiers are the number of rungs added for the first and second moves, respectively.

* Ladder on medium rungs leading with both hands
* Ladder on small rungs leading with both hands
* Baseline max ladder on small rungs leading with both hands
* Baseline +0/+1 max ladder on small rungs leading with both hands
* Up to 12 sets of progressively harder max ladders alternating leading hands
* Double dynos on medium rungs
* Baseline double dynos on small rungs
* Baseline +1/+1 double dynos on small rungs
* 2 sets of progressive double dynos
* Single rung up-down-up double dynos
* Double rung up-down-up double dynos
* 2 sets of progressive up-down-up double dynos

Tips:

* Avoid pausing or readjusting between moves
* Keep eyes open and focused on target throughout movement
* Practice deadpointing moves
* Focus on pushing with lower hand on big moves
* Twist inward for extra reach
* Do 2-4 supplemental strength exercises afterwards (1-3 sets of 8 or fewer reps)

#### Max Recruitment Hangboarding ####

* 4-5 grips
* 5 seconds on, 5 seconds off, 3 minutes rest between sets
* 5 reps in first set, 4 reps in second set, 3 reps in 3rd set
* Adjust weight ramp-up to fit accordingly

### Power Endurance (3-4 weeks) ###

Best to use the characteristics of the goal route to customize the phase:

* Number of moves per hand
* Handhold size and type
* Foothold size and type
* Wall angle
* Time duration required to climb it when wired
* Climbing pace
* Rest opportunities

Choose power endurance training in line with the intensity of the goal route.

Intensity | Exercise  | Simulates       | Set Duration | Hand Moves | Total Sets | Work:Rest
----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|------------|------------|----------
High      | LBC       | Long boulders   | 0:45 - 1:30  | 10 - 20    | 6 - 8      | 1:2 - 1:1
Mid       | LBC       | Bouldery routes | 1:30 - 4:00  | 20 - 40    | 4 - 6      | 1:2 - 1:1
Low       | Intervals | Pumpy routes    | 4:00 - 15:00 | 40 - 100   | 2 - 4      | 1:2 - 1:1

**Linked Bouldering Circuits (LBC)**: create an unbroken chain of boulder problems or a traverse without rests or shakes designed to mimic goal route as much as possible.  24 hand movements is a reasonable number.  Circuit should be sustained and easy enough that it can be done most of the time when warmed up and fresh.  Difficulty can be adjusted by changing the boulder problems that make up the circuit.

**Route Intervals**: do repeated laps on a route or boulder problem about a letter grade harder than consistent insight level.  Do 2-4 laps with a rest of 1-2x of the work time between laps.  Can be done at the end of a day of limit redpoint climbing.

Notes:

* Warm up with the same warmup as used for power training 
* Move from 2x rest towards 1x rest during phase
* Use powerful dynamic moves that are well rehearsed
* End a set if you fall due to fatigue, but get back on if you slip
* End workout if you fail due to fatigue before getting through 3/4 of the set
* Try to use a pace similar to the goal route
* Cool down with ARC and stretching
* Rest 48-72 hours between workouts

### Sending (3-4 weeks) ###

Something of a continuation of the power endurance phase where the focus shifts more towards outdoor climbing. Will get an endurance peak after the power endurance phase, and a power peak after the power phase, so plan routes accordingly.

### Rest (1 week) ###

Sleep and take care of skin

## Gimme Kraft Campus Exercises ##

All feet free exercises seem to be on medium or large rung

**Squaredance Footless**

* Hang with both hands on medium or large rung
* Pull up with RH and skip at least one rung. Latch high rung with LH
* Match top rung with RH
* Campus down to initial rung with LH
* Match initial rung and repeat leading with other hand 

**Crossover**

* Start matched on a large rung
* Pull up with both hands and cross over diagonally to next rung (or 2 rungs up to make harder).  Be sure to lock off and stabilize with lower hand
* Cross over again to next rung with other hand. Can match first to make exercise easier
* Do 2-3 reps per arm, jump off, and rest

**Campus Boulder**

* Combine 10-15 moves to simulate a project
* For instance:
    * Start with 2 cross overs
    * 3 campus moves up
    * Move sideways to different rung size
    * Campus down trying to skip as many rungs as possible
    * Do 1-2 double dynos upwards
